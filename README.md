# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize the Air Quality Index (AQI) using data from a CSV file. The analysis includes a variety of graphs and charts to illustrate the findings. The project is implemented in Python and can be executed in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the CSV file with AQI data.
- **notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook for the project.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Required Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the CSV file is present in this directory.

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-quality-index-analysis.git
cd air-quality-index-analysis
```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

   - **Using Jupyter Notebook:**

     Open the `AQI_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

   - **Using Google Colab:**

     Upload the `AQI_Analysis.ipynb` file to Google Colab.

3. **Execute the Code:**

   Run each code cell in the notebook. The output will be displayed after each cell, including tables, graphs, and charts.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**

   - Load the CSV file and explore the data.
   - Display summary statistics and data types.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - Visualize data distributions.
   - Explore relationships between different features and the AQI.

4. **Data Visualization:**

   - Use various graphs and charts to illustrate the findings.
   - Highlight trends and patterns in the AQI data.

## Results

The project provides insights into the air quality index, showcasing the variations and trends over time. The results are presented through various visualizations, making it easy to understand the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Python for data analysis and visualization in examining the air quality index. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can replicate the analysis and gain insights into air quality trends.
